## Status of this project

This project started as a playground to learn ReactJS. Then it turned out that it's actually useful 
so I decided to finish and release it. With early adopters I will continue development.  

## What's under the hood

Roombelt takes advantage of the following tools:
- code formatting - [prettier](https://prettier.io/) 
- bootstrapping ReactJS app - [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- backend server - [express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- ORM - [sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/)
- app state management - [redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- side effects in redux - [redux-play](https://github.com/ziolko/redux-play)
- selectors library - [reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)
- frontend routing - [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
- animation library - [react-spring](https://github.com/drcmda/react-spring)
- offline mode - create react app web worker + [custom code for handling offline](https://github.com/ziolko/roombelt/blob/master/src/apps/device/store/plays/heartbeat.js)

I've tried a few technologies that eventually didn't make it: 
- [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/) - I didn't have time to do PhD on observables. I've decided to use redux-play instead.
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) - Too much boilerplate for this kind of app. Good old REST API was both easier and faster to develop.
- [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) - Server side rendering didn't really make sense in this app. Decided to use CRA instead.
